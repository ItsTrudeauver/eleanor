    <p>
        <i>Street noise. Heavy doors swing open. The inside of a shop, cluttered. Machinery hums faintly.</i><br>
        <b>Memphis: </b><i>(gruff)</i> Maddie. And a friend.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Looking to arm up.<br>
        <i>Memphis sniffs, wipes his nose, then walks further into the shop. Clatter of metal. Drawers open.</i><br>
        <b>Memphis: </b>You want the <i>real</i> stuff, I got a Raptor 7 with mod rails from yours truly. Funeral pyre at your command.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Something small.<br>
        <i>Silence. The clatter stops.</i><br>
        <b>Memphis: </b>...Small.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b><i>(low mutter)</i> Here we go.<br>
        <i>More shifting. Memphis sets something down with more force than necessary.</i><br>
        <b>Memphis: </b>SOF-22. Clean, balanced. Ain't a pea shooter but won't tear a hole through a train either. 200.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>I'll take it. One mag.<br>
        <i>Beat. Memphis exhales through his nose. The register beeps.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b><i>(mutters)</i> You really don't intend to use that thing, huh.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>If I have to, I will.<br>
        <b>Memphis: </b><i>(low)</i> That's what they all say. Get your friend outta here Maddie, she's no fun. Mag's free.<br>
        <i>Eleanor and Madeleine walk away. Car door open and shut. Engine revs.</i>
        <b>Madeleine:</b><i>(chuckles)</i> At least you didn't ask him for a rail gun.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>A what?
