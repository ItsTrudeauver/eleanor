    <h2>Audio from On-Person Recorder – March 5, 2057, 16:02</h2>
<p>
    <i>Street noise. Distant voices. Echoing footsteps.</i><br>
    <b>Madeleine: </b>Tunnel to 14th. Best place to get storage without questions.<br>
    <b>Eleanor: </b>No back room deals?<br>
    <b>Madeleine: </b>You pay, you get a key. Simple.<br>
    <i>More footsteps. A murmured conversation between two vendors. Keys rattle.</i><br>
    <b>Vendor: </b>Pick one. You lose the key, it's on you.<br>
    <b>Eleanor: </b>...This one.<br>
    <i>Key scrapes into a lock. A door creaks open; small space, steel walls. Barely enough to fit two crates.</i><br>
    <b>Madeleine: </b>...Still surprised how much money that is. Aaand you trynna keep it in one place.<br>
    <b>Eleanor: </b>I have to split it then?<br>
    <b>Madeleine:</b> Yeah no shit. Buy more keys if you gotta. You're lucky it's empty this hour.<br>
    <b>Madeleine: </b>Keep just enough on you to get by.<br>
    <i>Eleanor exhales, adjusting the bag on her shoulder.</i><br>
    <b>Eleanor: </b>Got it.<br>
    <i>Metal clangs. The lock clicks shut.</i><br>
