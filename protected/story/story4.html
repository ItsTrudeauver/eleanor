        <i>Metal clanging, machine whirring. Man, thick accent, impatient, inspecting.</i><br>
        <b>Scrapyard boss:</b> '49 CTT Series huh? Not worth much.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b> Not asking for much.<br>
        <b>Scrapyard boss: </b> Three grand. Take out your stuff, I only need the car.<br>
        <i>Eleanor doesn't argue. Walks to the car, gets her glovebox stuff. Unlocks the trunk. A dull thud. Madeleine

        <b>Madeleine:</b> You realize people die for way less right?<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Then let's move. <br>

        <i>She slings the bag over her shoulder. Starts walking. Madeleine rubs her face, mutters something under her
