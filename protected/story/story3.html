        <i>Car stops. Doors click open. Eleanor and Madeleine step out. Doors close</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Pick something loose. Hoodie, baggy jeans, tinted glasses. No skin. Gloves<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b> Gloves?<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Smooth hands, not a scratch. Someone catches a glimpse and you're dragged<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>...Fine. But why are you not wearing loose clothes? You're younger than me.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>I got someone watching my back.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b> Who?<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b> You'll meet him soon. <br>
        <i>Eleanor and Madeleine walks to the reception stall.</i><br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>We'll trade these for my old clothes if that works?<br>
        <b>Shop owner: </b>Look at miss Fancy here talking like she owns the damn place. Ain't no one buying your fresh
        wears. 20 or bust.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Cut it Jim. You can just drive over her clothes.<br>
        <b>Shop owner: </b>Yo Maddie you know this chick? Where the fuck's her fancy ass from. <br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>50 and I'll spill. <br>
        <b>Shop owner: </b>Eh fuck it, I'll take your Guccis.<br>
        <i>Cash register sounds. Madeleine and Eleanor get back into the car, drive to the scrapyard.</i><br>
