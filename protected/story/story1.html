    <h2>First Day</h2>
    <b><strong>Audio from car monitor, March 4 2057, 17:20</strong></b>
    <p>
        <i>Woman walks out, 80 meters in front of Eleanor's car.</i><br>
        <i>Car brakes</i><br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Woah woah woah lady hold <br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> Hm? What? <br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> What do you mean what? Look at the shit you wear and drive <br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> Sorry, I don't have time for this. What do you want?<br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Lady, you see this place? Your car has "Please rob me!" painted on it.<br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> I'm just finding someone.<br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> You know where they are? Exact corner of exact street?<br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> No, but why do you care if I got robbed?<br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> 50 bucks and I'll show you around, get you a place to stay. Deal?<br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> Why should I believe you? <br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Because if you look to your left you'll see a building with maybe a dozen thugs about to
        jump you <br>
        <b>Unknown man, loud, hoarse:</b> Stop bitching in you whore! <br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Shut the fuck up Carrick, you ain't tough! <br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> ... <br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Look I don't give a shit about you at all but 50 is 50. You go in there alone, deal with
        all those guys and a bunch of others. Of course you can just leave but that'll be 50 for me saving your life. <br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> Don't really have a choice do I? <br>
        <b>Unknown woman:</b> Smart.<br>
        <i>Car door opens, unknown woman sits.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b> Turn right at that three-way. You need to get some worse clothes and a worse car. Name's Madeleine, by the way. Maddie's fine.<br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> Where are we heading exactly?<br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b> Worse clothes, worse car. Don't worry, they pay. Not gonna rob you blind.<br>
        <b>Eleanor:</b> If this is a set-up you'll be the first to kiss dirt. <br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b> Ooh, easy Tiger. <br>
        <i>Car revs, continue</i>
