        <i>Footsteps. A door creaks. Dim lighting. The space is cramped: barely a room, more of a hole in the wall. A
            mattress, a chair, a table. Rust stains on the floor. Two barely visible electricity outlets.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Welcome to your new palace.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>...Functional.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Adapting real good huh.<br>
        <i>Eleanor sets the bag down, pulls the chair out. The legs scrape.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Right. Next thing, you want a gun, you see Memphis. Dont let him talk you into something
        stupid.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Why are you doing all this?<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>You paid. You're my guest now.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Way to host a guest.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b><i>(chuckles)</i> Whatever. Anyway, you need anything else, you barter. Cash is cash but it
        ain't all-powerful.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b> Probably need some place to hide your stash too.<br>
        <i>Madeleine exhales, stretches.</i>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Right.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Tomorrow you'll learn how to act the part.<br><br><br>

        Guess I am here now in Norwager. Scrapped my car, traded my clothes. I looked in the half-broken mirror and saw
        a lost person with little to hang on. I heard someone screaming a few blocks away just now. This isn't me, and
        Norwager isn't where I live. <br><br>
        <i>Audio interrupts. Loud banging noises outside.</i><br>
        <i>Door clicks. Locked. Key sound on the table.</i><br><br>
        I probably shouldn't look into what that was. I don't know why I thought coming here was a good idea. When I 
        knew where Rasmus was exiled to, I didn't have an ounce of hesitation. <br><br>
        <i>Long pause. Head scratching noise.</i><br><br>
        But I already made the call. Guess I'm a rogue now, how fun.
