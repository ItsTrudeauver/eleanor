        Didn't know bartering was this difficult. Got ripped off for some...canned food? Ugh, expires next week. Better
        hurry. If Rasmus is here then someone must be feeding him. There's no way he could ever talk to a single person 
        let alone trade with them.

        Madeleine's not kind. But there's something in the way she makes sure I don't screw up. Maybe because it's so easy
