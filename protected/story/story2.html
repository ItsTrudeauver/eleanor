    <h2>Make-over</h2>
    <b><strong>Audio from car monitor, March 4 2057, 17:31</strong></b>
    <p>
        <i>(Engine idling. Eleanor's hands tighten on the wheel. Madeleine slouches in the passenger seat)</i> <br>

        <b>Madeleine:</b> First thing, ditch the car.<br>
        <b>Eleanor</b>: It's good cover. <br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b> You know it's not. Scrap it. You don't need a fancy car here.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>...Fine.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Next, you. Clean face, good teeth, hair still shines under shit lighting. That's gonna get you
        killed. Or worse.<br>
        <i>(Pause. Eleanor exhales through her nose. Doesn't ask further)</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b>Hoodie up. Get some baggy clothes. No skin. No polish, no gloss. You smell too nice. Change
        that. <br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Where am I going to get all those? <br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Thrift store next to the scrap yard. They set it up like that for a reason.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Don't flash creds. Cash only. No banks, no chips. You get food at ground stalls. No one haggles. If
            you ask why, you're already fucked. Understand?<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Noted. <br>
        <i>(Pause. Madeleine smirks, stretching.)</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine:</b> Quick on the uptake. Could almost like you.<br>
