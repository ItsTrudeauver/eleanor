    <h2>Personal Audio Log – March 5, 2057, 08:02</h2>
    <p>
        Slept like shit. Concrete walls don't block much noise. Someone was fighting in the alley around four. My back
        hurts. I miss coffee that doesn't taste like rain runoff.

        <i>Footsteps. A lighter flicks open, then closes. </i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>First thing, if you're gonna last here, you need to stop looking like someone who can afford
        to leave.<br>
        <i>Eleanor exhales through her nose.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>You got clean hands, clean hair, clean nails, shit even your posture's wrong.
        These people look at you and they see someone soft, someone worth rolling.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>...And I assume you have a solution.<br>
        <i>Metal clinks. A pack of cigarettes lands on the table.</i><br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>Start small.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>You want me to smoke.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>I want you to look like someone who has to smoke. Ain't a social thing here. It's
        stress, boredom, or keeping hands warm. Pick one.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Right.<br>
        <i>The pack rustles. A cigarette is drawn. Lighter flicks again.</i><br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b><i>(soft exhale)</i> ...Tastes like burnt paper.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>You'll live.<br>
        <i>Eleanor tries again. Heavy coughs. Madeleine laughs.</i>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>You're not a softie after all.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Don't have a choice.<br>
        <b>Madeleine: </b>You know you can just leave right. 50 and you're outta here.<br>
        <b>Eleanor: </b>Would pay you 50 to jam it.<br>
        <i>Madeleine laughs again as Eleanor tries to not cough.</i>
